  - Create a getting started guide
  - Conduct user testing and gather feedback

#### 3.2 Error Handling
**Risk**: Poor error messages leading to user frustration
- **Likelihood**: High
- **Impact**: Medium
- **Mitigation**:
  - Provide clear, actionable error messages
  - Implement error logging for debugging
  - Add retry mechanisms for transient errors
  - Show helpful suggestions when errors occur
  - Implement graceful degradation for non-critical features

### 4. Business Risks

#### 4.1 Cost Management
**Risk**: Unexpected API costs due to high usage
